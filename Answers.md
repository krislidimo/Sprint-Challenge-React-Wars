1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

	React JS is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook that allows us to create modular components. React allows us to better manage a dynamic application with lots of moving parts and changing state. DOM manipulation without React is very resource intensive. React utilizes a virtual DOM that enhances this experience.
